After these prerequisites are met download sChat and drop it into the plugins/ folder. Restart the server and you are done. Multi-Server Networks If you have a multi server setup using Bungeecord or Velocity , then download the plugin for the proxy and restart the proxy as well. Initial Configuration \u00b6 sChat comes with two preconfigured channels: global and team . The latter can only be accessed by players that have the schat.channel.team.join permission. It is protected . Both channels are global and forward messages to all servers. Here is a quick overview of the channel configuration. Each setting is explained in great detail in the channel configuration section. Global Channel Config channels : global : name : \"<#189AB4>Global\" # colors the name with the given hex formatted color settings : protected : false # the channel can be joined without a permission auto_join : true # the channel is added automatically to players global : true # messages are forwarded to all servers on the network forced : true # the channel cannot be left team : name : \"Team\" settings : protected : true # the channel can only be joined with the 'schat.channel.team.join' permission auto_join : true global : true forced : false # players can leave the channel if they wish You can reload the channel configuration on-the-fly with the /schat reload command. Do I need to set all options of a channel for it to be valid? No. The only thing you need to configure for a valid channel is the name. channels : minimal : name : Minimal What do I need to configure on the proxy? The proxy does not require any configuration and only serves as a message relay between servers. This might change in the future. But for know you don't need to touch the proxy config. Full config.yml \u00b6 Here is the complete config.yml how it is shipped with the plugin. sChat will automatically save and overwrite a config.default.yml on every start. The default config always contains the latest settings. You can also take a look at the configuration reference to see which options exist and when they were added. config.yml ################################################################################################## #+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+# #| |# #| _________ .__ __ |# #| _____\\_ ___ \\| |__ _____ _/ |_ |# #| / ___/ \\ \\/| | \\\\__ \\\\ __\\ |# #| \\___ \\\\ \\___| Y \\/ __ \\| | |# #| /____ >\\______ |___| (____ |__| |# #| \\/ \\/ \\/ \\/ |# #| |# #| Supercharge your Minecraft Chat Experience! |# #| |# #| WIKI: https://schat.silthus.net/docs |# #| DISCORD: https://discord.gg/R4st4QxAjb |# #| BUG REPORTS: https://github.com/sVoxelDev/sChat/issues |# #| |# #| New options are not added to this file automatically.
