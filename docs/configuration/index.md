# Configuration

The configuration documentation of sChat is split into two parts.
One for [common settings][reference], like logging, private chats and so on.
The second part goes into detail how you can configure and setup [channels][channels].

!!! warning "New Config Options"
    New config options are not automatically added to the `config.yml`.  
    The default option will be used if nothing is configured.  
    Take a look at the [configuration reference][reference] to see what options where added when.
